# <h3>Word-Level Language Identification for Resource-Scarce Languages<h3> 
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>This README is a description of the datasets contained on this page; the datasets were used for the word-level language identification research for resource-scarce languages. The word-level language identification strategy proposed in the research was performed through the pattern analysis of the character trigrams of the featured languages. Languages featured in this research are English, Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. The word-level language identification strategy does not require large corpus which are needed in/for previous word-level language identification and other natural language processing research. Secondly, this strategy potentially works for all languages whose writing systems are alphabet-based.</p> 
<h4>File Manifest</h4>
<p>There are three types of Files</p>
<li><ul>1. Python Program: The Python program is contained in a python file named trigramAnalyzer.py. Kindly refer to the Operating Instructions for details of the Python program</ul>
  <ul>2. Corpora: </ul>
  <ul>3. Result of the Research: The result of the research include the research result, character trigram-frequency and the word-frequency of English, Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba texts used for the research. These results are presented in Trigams.xls and WORDList&Results.xls files for the trigrams-frequency, and word-frequency/results of the research respectively</ul>
