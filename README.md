# Word Level Language Identification for Resource-Scarce 
# <h3>Word-Level Language Identification for Resource-Scarce Languages<h3> 
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>This README is a description of the datasets, research results and python program contained on this page; the datasets were used for the word-level language identification research for resource-scarce languages. The word-level language identification strategy proposed in the research was performed through the pattern analysis of the character trigrams of the featured languages. Languages featured in this research are English, Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. The word-level language identification strategy does not require large corpus which are needed in/for previous word-level language identification and other natural language processing research. Secondly, this strategy potentially works for all languages whose writing systems are alphabet-based.</p> 
<h4>File Manifest</h4>
<p>There are three types of Files</p>
<ol>
  <li>Python Program: The Python program is contained in a python file named trigramAnalyzer.py. Kindly refer to the Operating Instructions for details of the Python program</li>
  <li>Corpora: One of the contributions of this research is the corpora of the three Nigerian languages (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) which we are making available to the public through this data repository. Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba electronic texts (please note the English corpora is not provided because we do not have copyright permission to make it available) are provided on this repository; all the corpora have been largely cleaned of foreign words. Though the corpora have been cleaned, the sentence structures are still maintained. The Hausa corpus has a text size of 190,833 with vocabulary size of 9,247. The Hausa corpus is not marked, that is the diacritically marked characters have been replaced with the unmarked equivalents. The Hausa corpus was harvested online from news and Christian religion organizations' websites. The Igbo corpus is fully diacritically marked, it has a text size of 125,690 with a vocabulary size of 6,737. The Igbo corpus was also harvested online largely from news and Christian religion organizations' websites. The Yoruba corpus is a part of the larger corpus that was used for this research that could be made available to the public; other part cannot be made available because of copyright issues. The Yoruba corpus has a text size of 116,652 and a vocabulary size of 6,954. </li>
  <li>Research Result: The research results include the research analysis, character trigram-frequency and the word-frequency of English, Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba texts used for the research. These results are presented in Trigams.xls and WORDList&Results.xls files for the trigrams-frequency, and word-frequency/research analysis respectively</li>
